SeshOS takes the security of our software and services seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any SeshOS-owned repository, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Instead, please
report them to the SeshOS vulnerability email at [email@email.com](mailto:email@email.com).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via
email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better
understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
